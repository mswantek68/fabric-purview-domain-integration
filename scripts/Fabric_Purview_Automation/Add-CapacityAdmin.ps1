.SYNOPSIS
    Assign Capacity Admin role to a service principal (requires existing Fabric Admin).

.DESCRIPTION
    This script can assign Capacity Admin permissions to a service principal,
    but it requires the person running it to ALREADY be a Fabric Administrator.
    
    This is a workaround, not a full solution, because:
    - You still need manual Fabric Admin assignment for the FIRST admin
    - This only assigns Capacity Admin (not Fabric Administrator)
    - Requires interactive login as a user who is Fabric Admin

.PARAMETER ServicePrincipalId
    The App ID (Client ID) of the service principal to make capacity admin

.PARAMETER CapacityName
    The name of the Fabric capacity

.PARAMETER CapacityResourceGroup
    The resource group containing the capacity

.EXAMPLE
    # Run as a user who is already Fabric Administrator
    ./Add-CapacityAdmin.ps1 `
        -ServicePrincipalId "abc123..." `
        -CapacityName "fabriccapacityprod" `
        -CapacityResourceGroup "rg-fabric-prod"

.NOTES
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  LIMITATIONS:
    - This only assigns Capacity Admin, NOT Fabric Administrator
    - Requires YOU to already be Fabric Admin
    - Requires interactive browser login (can't be fully automated)
    - Each capacity must be assigned separately
